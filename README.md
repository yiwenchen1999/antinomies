#### Antinomies  
Antinomies is the game I designed for the 2019 GameJam in Chengdu. My teammates are: two artists and another programmer.This game is finished in 48 hours.

The game is a puzzle solving game. The protagnist is controlled by pressing 'A','W','S','D' and the interactive button 'F'. 

Move the chracter and push around the boxes to solve this puzzle.

If your character touch the square with an eye on it, you win!
